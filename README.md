# GParticles: a generic, GPU-focused Particle Engine

A particle system is a collection of individual entities that have both a set of data and behavior rules. These entities, or particles, interact with each other and/or with the environment, forming a system that models a large-scale visual effect. Particle systems are a commonly employed method to reproduce "_fuzzy_" and natural phenomena, or chaotic systems composed by many individual entities (smoke, fire, water, herds, abstract effects, ...).  The main idea is that the viewer will only perceive the effect being modeled and not the particles themselves, since they all work as a cohesive unit.

Most implementations of particle systems process data on the CPU and transfer that data to the graphics hardware for rendering, a bottleneck that limits the maximum number of particles at around 10.000 instances. GParticles stores and processes all particle data directly on the GPU, eliminating the previous limitation, which allows the development of systems composed by millions of particles.

GParticles also provides a simple but powerful architecture that promotes reusability and modularity of functionality, with many utilities that let the user extend particle system behavior and configurations at different abstraction levels.

Be sure to visit the GParticles wiki (<https://github.com/tiagoddinis/GParticles/wiki>) to lear more. There you can find a tutorial series, the xml project definition file documentation and more information about the library architecture and its components.

Here are a few examples of what can be achieved with GParticles:

This project was an assignment for the Computer Engineering Lab class of my [Computer Engineering Master's Degree](https://www.di.uminho.pt/miei.html). I chose [Computer Graphics](http://www3.di.uminho.pt/uce-cg/>) as the project profile and developed GParticles with the guidance of [informatic department](https://www.di.uminho.pt/) assistant professor At√≥nio Ramires (<http://www.lighthouse3d.com/>, <https://github.com/Nau3D/nau>).
